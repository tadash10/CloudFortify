here's an overview of some of the ISO standards that could be relevant for a script aimed at hardening cloud infrastructure:

    ISO/IEC 27001:2013 - This standard lays out the requirements for an information security management system (ISMS). Implementing ISO 27001 can help organizations identify and manage risks to their information assets, and ensure that appropriate controls are in place to protect them.

    ISO/IEC 27017:2015 - This standard provides guidelines for implementing security controls specifically for cloud services. It covers issues such as data location, access controls, and security incident management.

    ISO/IEC 27018:2019 - This standard provides additional guidelines for protecting personal data in cloud services. It includes requirements for data handling, data retention, and data disclosure.

    ISO/IEC 27002:2013 - This is a general code of practice for information security management. It provides a comprehensive set of guidelines for implementing security controls and managing information security risks.

    ISO/IEC 22301:2019 - This standard specifies the requirements for a business continuity management system (BCMS). Implementing ISO 22301 can help organizations prepare for and respond to disruptive events such as cyber attacks, natural disasters, or other emergencies.

When hardening a cloud infrastructure, it's important to consider these and other relevant ISO standards, along with any industry-specific regulations or compliance requirements that may apply. By following these standards and best practices, organizations can help ensure that their cloud environments are secure, resilient, and compliant with relevant regulations and standards.
